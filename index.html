                    <p>
                        The Birthday of the girl who became my first ever Girlfriend. During my battle with my anxiety, I missed you even though you weren't aware of me at that time as I still didn't tell you my feelings, I battled my worst battle to fix myself just to meet you again as I knew your Birthday was coming. A gift for you was 1 small potted flower, 2 Purple Yam small cakes, and 5 different colored roses.

                    <p>
                        My first moment with you as a suitor was when I confessed everything and asked permission to be a suitor of yours on November 13, 2023. The time with you at YAKĀ was the very best gift I received, getting to know you like personally and not chat was a priceless moment for me. A lot of coincidence for the both of us that I seem to think about it so much haha.

                    <p>
                        The moment where I asked you out for the second time, when I cooked for someone just show that even with a big figure of mine, I still know how to cook, and to let you taste the food I cooked for you. We talked a lot, I got to know you better, The majority of our talks were the life with our family at that time.

                    <p>
                        The day I asked you out for the third time even though it was a rainy evening. Buying a pizza for the both of us, furthermore, the initial venue was Folk Arts, it rained and as it rained, I had to quickly come up with another plan, it shows how I really wanted to spend time with you. Even though I was so mentally tired at that time, the moment with you, like with just the two of us, all of the stress just went away immediately.

                    <p>
                        The last week of your Field Study at Bukidnon National High School and the last moment of us in my hometown in 2023. We had so many misunderstandings that it caused pain and unnecessary thoughts to each of us, it was the day that it made everything clear. Both of us don't have a lot of experience in this relationship we entered, but just know that we are already mature enough to face challenges as a team.

                    <p>
                        The last moment we made in the year 2023, the day we watched "Rewind" in the cinema, the day I officially became your ever first Boyfriend as well as you became my first ever Girlfriend at the Hill Top Camp Bar. You were so cryptic at that time anga ka, but to think all of my risk and efforts were worth it in the end huhu. I love you Antee, I love you Chaylenmie E. Balaba, let's create more memories this year 2024, and work this relationship together.
